 * Overstrike is accomplished with a pair of Overstrike control sequences. A beginning OVS with a

 * in BypassIdentity bits 4-7 deactivates overstrike. The beginning OVS control sequence immediately
 * precedes the field of text to be overstruck. It specifies the following.
 * <p>- The overstrike character</p>
 * <p>- How to place the overstrike characters in relation to the characters in the text field<p>
 * <p>- Which controlled inline white space is to be overstruck.</p>
 * The text field to be overstruck, called the overstrike field, is delimited by the beginning OVS
 * and either an ending OVS control sequence or the end of the Presentation Text object. The
 * overstrike field is a sequential string of presentation text.
