AFP-Parser is a Java library used for parsing IBMs Advanced Function Printing
document format.

The client API works on two levels, a parser for structured field introducers
and a separate API for parsing the content of structured fields. The intention
being that it gives maximum flexibility to the client to control the behaviour
of the parser.
